# War-Card-Game



For this game, you will need one standard deck of 52 face cards without jokers.
This game is only meant for two people to play.
This is a simple game that involves little strategy or skill. 
All it requires is the ability to recognize which of two cards has a higher value.
In this game the value of cards from lowest to highest is: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A
No suit has a higher value than another.
Steps:
1.After shuffling the deck, deal out all of the cards. 
  Each player will have half of the deck(26 cards).
  Players should not look at their cards, or arrange them in any certain order.
2.Both players take the top card off of their pile and place it face up in the playing area.
  The player that played the higher card wins the round and takes both cards.
  If there is a tie, then apply the rules of a "war"(see step three).
  These two cards are added to the bottom the deck of cards of the player that won the round.
  Continue play until one player holds all of the cards.
3.A war is when both players turn over cards of the same rank.
  In this case more action must be taken to determine who wins the round.
  Start by having each player place three cards off the top of their deck face down in the playing area. 
  A fourth card is then played face up.
  The player with the higher fourth card wins and takes all of the cards played during that round.
  If the fourth card is also a tie then repeat this process until there is a decisive victory.
  If you run out of cards in the middle of a war your last card is placed face up and is used as your card for the war.
  If there is another tie, the person who ran out of cards will keep their last card face up as the card they use. 
  If a player still has cards they will continue to follow the normal rules of war.
